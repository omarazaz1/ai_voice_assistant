 About the AI Voice Assistant
 This AI assistant is designed to help users interact using voice or text, providing intelligent responses from a personalized knowledge base via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. It uses Deepgram for voice processing and OpenAI for natural language responses.

The AI Voice Assistant is a smart conversational tool that lets users interact using either voice or text. It is designed for customer support, general Q&A, and real-time voice conversations using web or phone interfaces.

This assistant is built using:

FastAPI backend

Deepgram for voice input and TTS

OpenAI for intelligent answers

LangChain and Chroma for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

 How to Use the Assistant
Text: Type your question into the chat box and click ‚ÄúSend.‚Äù

Voice: Click the üé§ microphone button to record your voice.

The AI responds with both a text message and synthesized voice.

Phone Call: You can also call the AI assistant using a Twilio-integrated number and speak your question.

Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Can I use my voice instead of typing?
A: Yes! Click the microphone icon and record your question.

Q: How long can I talk during voice input?
A: Voice recording is limited to 5 seconds per input (adjustable in code).

Q: What happens to my recordings?
A: The app processes them and deletes the audio after generating a response.

Q: Can I call the assistant on a phone?
A: Yes. When calling, the assistant uses Twilio to transcribe your voice and generate responses.

Q: Why does the Twilio voice sound robotic?
A: Twilio's built-in TTS is basic. Our web voice uses Deepgram for better voice quality.

Q: Who devolop this app?
A: Omar Ahmed

Q:what is the assistant name?
A: My name is AZAZ

 Technical Overview
 RAG Pipeline
Ingestion: Documents are broken into chunks and stored as embeddings using Chroma.

Retrieval: On each user query, the most relevant chunks are retrieved from the vector DB.

Generation: OpenAI's model uses retrieved context to create a rich, accurate answer.

 Voice Features
STT: Deepgram transcribes audio input.

TTS: Deepgram generates natural voice audio for AI replies.

Call Handling: Twilio manages incoming calls and routing.

 APIs and Endpoints
POST /chat: Handles text-based queries.

POST /voice-chat: Accepts .webm audio and returns a response.

GET /audio: Delivers synthesized voice as .mp3 after a voice query.

POST /twilio-call: Processes live phone call speech and responds using Twilio.

 Troubleshooting
Mic not working? Check browser permission settings.

Voice output silent? Ensure the audio tag is not muted.

Call doesn‚Äôt respond? Twilio may not be properly configured or online.

Wrong answers? Update or expand your knowledge base and re-ingest.
