## How It Works

1. User speaks into the app (mic input or phone call).
2. Audio is sent to the FastAPI backend.
3. The backend uses Deepgram to transcribe voice to text.
4. That text query is passed to LangChain, which retrieves relevant context from -ChromaDB-.
5. The final prompt is sent to OpenAI, which generates a response.
6. The response is turned into audio using Deepgram TTS.
7. Both the response text and generated audio are sent back to the frontend.
